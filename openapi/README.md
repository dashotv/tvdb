## üèó **Welcome to your new SDK!** üèó

It has been generated successfully based on your OpenAPI spec. However, it is not yet ready for production use. Here are some next steps:
- [ ] üõ† Make your SDK feel handcrafted by [customizing it](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/customize-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Refine your SDK quickly by iterating locally with the [Speakeasy CLI](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy)
- [ ] üéÅ Publish your SDK to package managers by [configuring automatic publishing](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/productionize-sdks/publish-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ú® When ready to productionize, delete this section from the README

<!-- Start Error Handling -->
# Error Handling

Handling errors in your SDK should largely match your expectations.  All operations return a response object or an error, they will never return both.  When specified by the OpenAPI spec document, the SDK will return the appropriate subclass.
<!-- End Error Handling -->



<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client -->
# Custom HTTP Client

The Go SDK makes API calls that wrap an internal HTTP client. The requirements for the HTTP client are very simple. It must match this interface:

```go
type HTTPClient interface {
	Do(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
}
```

The built-in `net/http` client satisfies this interface and a default client based on the built-in is provided by default. To replace this default with a client of your own, you can implement this interface yourself or provide your own client configured as desired. Here's a simple example, which adds a client with a 30 second timeout.

```go
import (
	"net/http"
	"time"
	"github.com/myorg/your-go-sdk"
)

var (
	httpClient = &http.Client{Timeout: 30 * time.Second}
	sdkClient  = sdk.New(sdk.WithClient(httpClient))
)
```

This can be a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration.
<!-- End Custom HTTP Client -->

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release!
